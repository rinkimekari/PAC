# PAC
Painfully Awful Communicator. Communications platform focused on privacy and security, hosted on a private server, written in Rust.

# NOTE
This is not even in beta. It's still being made, so dont try using it. It won't do what you want it to.

# Contributing
If you want to contribute just email me or message me some other way. Pull requests and issues at this stage in development wouldn't be very practial sadly, so just contacting me to figure something out would be best until this is ready for use. Thanks!
